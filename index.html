        <div class="subheading mb-5">Photographer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Keegan Boyse has gained experience in many different fields over the course of her life. Most recently, she shot a fashion campaign for Adidas sportswear, which was printed in many different mediums for advertising purposes, including magazines, billboards, and countless online platforms. Throughout this campaign Keegan worked as the lead photographer, as well as the creative director of the shoots. Each shoot had a different creative direction, and theme, both of which were imagined and created by Keegan, with the help of some set designers. 

She also shot product images for Bells Jewels which were printed in Beyond Our Minds magazine, and distributed all across the country. She acted as the sole mind behind this shoot’s theme, set design, creation, and editing. The final images were used for Bell Jewels’ website, business cards, advertising flyers, and will continue to be used in other forms by her company in the future. 

Throughout highschool she held three different jobs, and each required different skill sets.  She studied Studio Art at the University of California, Riverside from 2022 to 2026, before graduating with honors. During the time she was at UC Riverside, she worked among graduate students in the Photography Department of UC Riverside as a lab technician. She managed the student use of the darkrooms, which entailed mixing chemicals for film developing and printing, and checking on/changing those chemicals whenever necessary. She also worked in the digital photography lab, assisting students with photoshop, and large scale digital printing.  
<br><br>
        Prior to her experience working in the art industry, Keegan held a multitude of other positions in varying industries. She worked for multiple years as a receptionist at Onyx Hair Salon, developing her people skills and problem solving abilities. While managing the day to day tasks of the salon and assisting the hairstylist with managing their client’s experience.

In addition to working at Onyx, she worked for a small company, Doubletake, at the same time. Doubletake was a small tennis bag company owned by one woman who needed more employees to keep up with the fulfillment of orders. She worked in the packing and storage space putting together orders, and managing inventory.
<br><br>

        She also has experience working at Peninsula Golf and Country Club. She worked there for three years, holding various positions, including manager of the pool and gym, as well as a swim instructor. She worked here during the height of the Covid-19 Pandemic, and as a result developed unique skills that are valuable to any industry today.
